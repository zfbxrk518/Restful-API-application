# Restful-API-application

This is my homework2 form SK. He asked me to make a build a Restful API application with three requirements:
1. Use user register api endpoint
2. Use login api endpoint(JWT), return JWT
3. User data will be stored in a json file.
4. Use flask for the backend.

My blueprint:
Build a movie library website.This is a personal website for users to record their movies watched or not.For the homepage, contains the login, logout,forgot and reset password functions. When users log in, they can add, update and  delete the movie.

Tech:
Typerscript, Vue, Bootstrap, Flask
